    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Masala rice is a flavorful dish where fragrant, fluffy rice is paired with a 
        rich and spiced masala sauce. The key to preparing it well lies in cooking 
        the rice so that each grain stays separate and light, making it the perfect 
        base for the bold flavors of the sauce. By rinsing the rice thoroughly before 
        cooking, excess starch is removed, preventing stickiness. A quick sautÃ© in a 
        little oil or ghee can enhance the aroma and give the rice a nutty undertone 
        before it is simmered gently until tender.
    </p>
    <P>Once the rice is ready, it becomes the ideal companion for the pre-prepared 
         masala sauce, which is typically a blend of onions, tomatoes, and warm 
        spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. Serving the 
        rice alongside or topped with the sauce creates a balanced dish where the 
        mildness of the rice complements the depth and complexity of the masala. 
         This combination makes masala rice both comforting and satisfying, perfect 
        as a main meal or as part of a larger spread.
