    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade fries are a simple and delicious snack made by cutting potatoes into 
        sticks, soaking them to remove excess starch, then frying them twice to achieve 
        the perfect balance of a soft, fluffy interior and a crispy golden exterior. 
        After the first fry at a lower temperature to cook the potatoes through, 
        they are cooled and fried again at a higher heat to create that signature crunch. 
        Lightly seasoned with salt—or dressed up with spices, herbs, or cheese—they’re 
        best served hot with your favorite dipping sauces.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium potatoes (Russet or similar starchy type)</li>
        <li>2–3 cups vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, or parmesan for extra flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potatoes:</strong>Wash, peel (optional), 
            and cut into sticks about 1 cm thick. Try to keep them even for uniform 
            cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak:</strong>Place the cut potatoes in cold water for at 
            least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours). This removes excess starch and 
            makes them crispier.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry:</strong>Drain and pat the potatoes completely dry with a 
            towel—any water will cause splattering.</li>
        <li><strong>First fry:</strong>eat oil in a deep pan to 150 °C (300 °F). 
            Fry the potatoes in batches for about 4–5 minutes, until they’re soft 
            but not browned. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong>Let them cool for 10–15 minutes (this step helps with crispiness).</li>
        <li><strong>Second fry:</strong>Reheat oil to 190 °C (375 °F). 
            Fry the potatoes again in batches for 2–3 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Season & serve:</strong>Drain, sprinkle immediately with salt 
            (and any spices you like), then serve hot with ketchup, mayo, or your 
            favorite dip.</li>
    </ol>
