    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Few dishes bring the same level of comfort and satisfaction as a classic homemade lasagna. With its rich layers of seasoned meat sauce, 
        creamy béchamel (or ricotta, depending on the variation), perfectly cooked pasta, and a generous topping of melted cheese, 
        lasagna is a celebration of hearty Italian cooking. It's a dish often reserved for gatherings and special occasions, 
        but it's worth every bit of effort, delivering bold flavors and a satisfying texture in every bite.
    </p>

    <p>
        This version stays true to tradition, combining a slow-cooked meat sauce with a velvety ricotta mixture and gooey mozzarella, 
        all layered between sheets of pasta. The balance of savory meat, tangy tomato, 
        smooth cheese, and just the right amount of seasoning makes this lasagna deeply comforting and incredibly delicious. 
        Whether you're making it for a family dinner or prepping ahead for the week, this recipe is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Make the Meat Sauce:</li></strong>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
           Add the ground beef and sausage, breaking them up as they cook. Once browned, 
           drain excess fat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, 
           about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, 
           oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. 
           Pour in red wine or broth if using. Simmer uncovered for 20–30 minutes, 
           stirring occasionally until thickened.</p>
        <strong><li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:</li></strong>
        <p>In a bowl, combine ricotta, egg, Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. 
            Mix well and set aside.</p>
        <strong><li>Cook the Noodles:</li></strong>
        <p>If using regular noodles, cook them according to package instructions. 
            Drain and lay them flat on parchment paper to avoid sticking. 
            (Skip if using oven-ready noodles.)</p>
        <strong><li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li></strong>
        <p>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, 
            spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer with 3–4 noodles, 
            followed by a layer of ricotta mixture, meat sauce, 
            and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Repeat for 2–3 layers, 
            ending with noodles, sauce, and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan on top.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Bake:</li></strong>
        <p>Cover the dish with foil (tenting it slightly so it doesn't stick to the 
            cheese) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake uncovered for another 
            20 minutes until bubbly and golden brown.</p>
        <strong><li>Rest and Serve:</li></strong>
        <p>Let lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. 
            Garnish with chopped fresh basil or parsley if desired. Serve warm.</p>
    </ol>
